A black-and-white photograph depicts a woman standing beside a dark sedan with an open trunk in a parking garage, viewed through the diamond pattern of a chain-link fence.

The woman stands in the center, facing the open trunk of the car to her right. She wears a dark uniform jacket and skirt underneath a long, light-colored trench coat. Dark, splattered stains are prominently visible on the right lapel and shoulder area of her coat. She wears gloves, and her right hand rests on the edge of the raised trunk lid. She has long, straight hair and appears to be looking down into the trunk's interior.

The environment is an indoor parking structure. In the upper right background, a sign on the wall displays the letter "A". To the left, a wall corner is marked with diagonal hazard stripes. A large barrel or drum sits against the back wall, partially behind the woman.

The image is overlaid with a grid of out-of-focus, diamond-shaped shadows, suggesting the photograph was taken through a wire fence. The rear of the sedan occupies the foreground on the right, with its wheel and bumper visible, while the open trunk lid obscures the contents inside.
